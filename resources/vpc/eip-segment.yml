Description:
  zh-cn: 创建VPC弹性IP段，支持指定掩码、网络类型、带宽和计费方式，返回EIP段ID及EIP地址列表。
  en: Create a VPC Elastic IP segment, enabling specification of the mask, network
    type, bandwidth, and billing method, returning the EIP segment ID along with a
    list of EIP addresses.
Parameters:
  EipMask:
    Type: Number
    Description: |-
      The mask of the contiguous EIP group. Valid values:
      28: 16 contiguous EIPs are allocated for one call.
      27: 32 contiguous EIPs are allocated for one call.
      26: 64 contiguous EIPs are allocated for one call.
      25: 128 contiguous EIPs are allocated for one call.
      24: 256 contiguous EIPs are allocated for one call.
      Note The actual number of assigned EIPs may be less than the expected number because one,
      three, or four EIPs may be reserved.
    Default: 28
    AllowedValues:
    - 28
    - 27
    - 26
    - 25
    - 24
  ResourceGroupId:
    Type: String
    Description: The ID of the resource group to which the EIPs belong.
    Default: null
  Netmode:
    Type: String
    Description: |-
      The network type. Valid values:
      public: the Internet. This is the default value. After contiguous EIPs are associated with
      cloud resources, the cloud resources can access the Internet by using the EIPs.
      hybrid: the hybrid cloud. After contiguous EIPs are associated with cloud resources, the
      cloud resources can access the hybrid cloud by using the EIPs.
      Note This network type is available only to users who are added to the whitelist. To use
      this network type, contact your customer manager.
    Default: public
    AllowedValues:
    - public
    - hybrid
  Bandwidth:
    Type: Number
    Description: 'The maximum bandwidth of the contiguous EIPs. Unit: Mbit/s. Default
      value: 5.'
    Default: 5
  InternetChargeType:
    Type: String
    Description: |-
      The metering method of the contiguous EIPs. Valid values:
      PayByBandwidth: Fees are charged based on bandwidth usage. This is the default value.
      PayByTraffic: Fees are charged based on data transfer.
      Note If the Netmode parameter is set to hybrid, InternetChargeType is set to PayByBandwidth.
    Default: PayByBandwidth
    AllowedValues:
    - PayByBandwidth
    - PayByTraffic
