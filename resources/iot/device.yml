  zh-cn: 创建物联网产品与设备，定义设备类型、名称、操作权限及自定义话题类别，输出设备与产品详情。
  en: Create IoT products and devices by defining device types, names, operation permissions,
    and custom topic categories; output detailed information of devices and products.
Parameters:
  NodeType:
    Type: Number
    Description: |-
      The node type of the product. Values:
      0: Device. A device cannot be mounted with sub-devices. It can connect to IoT Platform
      either directly or as a sub-device of a gateway.
      1: Gateway. A gateway can be mounted with sub-devices. It can manage sub-devices, maintain
      the topological relationships with sub-devices, and synchronize the topological relationships
      to IoT Platform.
    Default: 0
  ProductName:
    Type: String
    Description: |-
      The name of the product. A product name can be 4 to 30 characters in length and can
      contain Chinese characters, English letters, digits, and underscores (_).
      Note A product name must be unique in an account.
    Default: mytest
  DeviceName:
    Type: String
    Description: |-
      The name of the device that you want to register. The device name must consist of
      4 to 32 characters, including English letters, digits, and special characters, for
      example, hyphens (-), underscores (_), at signs (@), periods (.) , and colons (:).
      DeviceName is used with ProductKey to identify a specified device.
      Note If you do not specify this parameter, the system will generate a name for the device.
    Default: mytest
  Operation:
    Type: String
    Description: |-
      Operation permissions of devices on the topic category. Value options:
      SUB: Subscribe. Devices can subscribe to the topics of this category.
      PUB: Publish. Devices can publish messages using the topics of this category.
      ALL: Subscribe and publish. Devices can subscribe to and publish messages to the topics of this category.

    - ALL
    - PUB
    - SUB
  TopicShortName:
    Type: String
    Description: |-
      The custom category hierarchy in the topic category. By default, a topic category contains two system defined category hierarchies: productKey and ${deviceName}. Forward slashes (/) are used to delimit the topic hierarchies. The format of a topic category is productKey/${deviceName}/topicShortName.
      Note The name of each category hierarchy can contain English letters, digits, and underscores (_), and cannot be empty.
    Default: mytest
  Desc:
    Type: String
    Description: The description of the topic category. You can enter a description
      with up to 100 characters.
    Default: null
