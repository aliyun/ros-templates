  WindowsCurlCli:
    Description: 'Convenience attribute, provides curl CLI command prefix for Windows,
      which can be used for signalling handle completion or failure. As Windows does
      not support curl command, you need to install curl.exe and add it to PATH first.
      You can signal success by adding --data-binary "{\"status\": \"SUCCESS\"}" ,
      or signal failure by adding --data-binary "{\"status\": \"FAILURE\"}" '

  PowerShellCurlCli:
    Description: 'Convenience attribute, provides curl CLI command prefix for PowerShell,
      which can be used for signalling handle completion or failure. As this cmdlet
      was introduced in PowerShell 3.0, ensure the version of PowerShell satisfies
      the constraint. (Show the version via $PSVersionTable.PSVersion.) You can signal
      success by adding -Body ''{"status": "SUCCESS"}'' , or signal failure by adding
      -Body ''{"status": "FAILURE"}'' '
