> If you are not familiar with Resource Orchestration Service (ROS), please read [What is ROS](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/resource-orchestration-service/latest/what-is-ros). If you are not familiar with the ROS template syntax, please refer to the [Getting started with templates](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/resource-orchestration-service/latest/get-started-with-templates).

> Welcome to experience ROS through the ROS [Console](https://ros-intl.console.aliyun.com/cn-beijing/stacks/create), [API](https://api.alibabacloud.com/product/ROS), [SDK](https://api.alibabacloud.com/api-tools/sdk/ROS), [CDK](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/resource-orchestration-service/latest/ros-cdk-overview).

## Introduction

Examples and best practices of ROS templates. The templates are categorized as follows:

- `resources`: Resource-level template examples that provide templates for single services or resources.
- `examples`: Comprehensive template examples that provide templates for simple scenarios. The template contents are the same as the ROS Console [Sample Templates](https://ros.console.aliyun.com/cn-beijing/samples).
- `solutions`: Solutions that provide template best practices for complex scenarios. The templates are the same as those in the ROS Console [Solution Center](https://ros.console.aliyun.com/cn-beijing/solutions).
- `transform`: Templates based on [Transform syntax](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/resource-orchestration-service/latest/template-syntax-transform), offering simplified templates for specific scenarios.
- `documents`：The templates involved in the Alibaba Cloud documents.
- `compute-nest-best-practice`: Best practice templates for [Compute Nest](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/computing-nest), providing templates for basic and advanced Compute Nest scenarios.
